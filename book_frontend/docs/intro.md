# Preface: Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Learn to build intelligent robots with ROS 2, from fundamentals to advanced AI integration.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide covers:

### 🤖 **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**
- ROS 2 fundamentals (nodes, topics, services)
- Robot descriptions with URDF
- Visualization with RViz2

### 🌍 **Module 2: Gazebo Simulation**
- Physics-based robot simulation
- Sensor simulation
- Environment modeling

### 🚀 **Module 3: Isaac Sim & Advanced Simulation**
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Advanced perception and navigation
- GPU-accelerated robotics

### 🧠 **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
- Speech-to-text with OpenAI Whisper
- LLM-based task planning (GPT-4/Claude)
- Visual grounding with CLIP
- End-to-end embodied AI

### 🏆 **Module 5: Capstone Project**

## About This Course

This book teaches you to build **Physical AI** systems - robots that combine:
- **Perception** (cameras, sensors)
- **Cognition** (LLMs, planning)
- **Action** (navigation, manipulation)

You'll learn by building, with hands-on examples using ROS 2 and modern AI tools.
